## Overview 👋🏾👋
There's a growing demand for more knowledge of heritage and DNA information from the African diaspora. There's also a real need in the same community for emotional and psychological respite and healing that travelling to mojority black nations brings. 
The African diaspora has been reaching back to their mother Africa and West Africa is welcoming them back. There's a vast untapped potential in the African diaspora to transform Sub Saharan Africa.  
Redricasa LLC is an organization created to ease the pain points that come with the migration of the African diaspora back to Africa by teaching the diaspora their mother tongues. 

## Inspiration 🌹
The inspiration for the Plantain app are many. One of the inspirations is the year of return 2019 where the African diaspora were called to visit Ghana in the year 2019. 
The other inspiration is the ever increasing connectedness and globalization taking place due to the utilization of technologies and increased interest of people groups about different cultures and ways of being.
My more personal inspiration comes from the need I saw for families from the African continent who are not able to pass on their heritage and cultures as fully due to the language barrier with their offspring. Plantain is one of the stapel starchy plants of many west African cuisines- thus the inspiration for the name of the app.

## Next Steps 💁🏾‍♀️
> Research West African languages and create a database of basic conversational phrases for each language

  > Round down the languages to just a handful or less. 
> get emojis and establish a color theme for each language: perhaps tribal patterns can be in the background!
> establish a trademark!
> Create a React native app version of the Plantain website>> Establish a unique name for the application - *
