# Plantain
African Diaspora languages by Redricasa LLC
## How to use the application üëåüèæüëå
The Plantain app is designed to make learning African tribal languages easy and fun. Much like Duolingo, a popular language learning app, Plantain is designed to have a well designed mobile-first application with a beautiful user experience and easy to navigate design.

## Overview üëãüèæüëã
There's a growing demand for more knowledge of heritage and DNA information from the African diaspora. There's also a real need in the same community for emotional and psychological respite and healing that travelling to majority black nations brings. 
The African diaspora has been reaching back to their mother Africa and West Africa is welcoming them back. There's a vast untapped potential in the African diaspora to transform Sub Saharan Africa to be able to compete in the global stage.  
Redricasa LLC is an organization created to ease the pain points that come with the migration of the African diaspora back to Africa by teaching the African diaspora their mother tongues. 

## Inspiration üåπ
The inspiration for the Plantain app are many. One of the inspirations is the [Year of Return](https://www.yearofreturn.com/) where the African diaspora were called to visit Ghana in the year of 2019 which marks the 400th year since the first ships left West Africa for the Americas. 
My more personal inspiration comes from the need I saw for families from the African continent, who are not able to pass on their heritage and cultures as fully due to the language barrier with their offspring. Plantain is one of the stapel starchy plants of many west African cuisines- thus the inspiration for the name of the app.

## Business Model/ The Lean Canvas: 
- Problems: 
    - lack of African Language learning apps that are engaging for children and young adults, 
    - a lack of materials for non-Romance language speakers to get a translation into African languages, 
    - a lack of platforms able to match African Language learners to African Language teachers
- Solutions for each problem: 
    - I'll build platforms that will be engaging for a younger audience. The platforms will be colorful and have representational           images that cusotmers will be able to identify with. 
    - The platform I'll build will eventually cater to non-Romance language speakers aiming to learn African Languages
    - The platform will also enable individualized tutorial sessions by utilizing qualified language teachers who'll be matched to          individuals electing a more intensive and personalized route.
